A WebGIS Portal prototype which makes use of various open source projects (OpenLayers, MapServer, SQLite/Spatialite, Turbo87/sidebar-v2, ol-layerswitcher, PROJ4, and hopefully I don't forget anything...).

To try it out, just download the [latest proj4 dist folder](https://github.com/proj4js/proj4js/releases) and place it in the `ol/` directory.

The files with "VPN" suffix are meant only for tests of this repository's owner and should not be used.
